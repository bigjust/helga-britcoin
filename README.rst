Genesis Block Notes:

::

  Happy Birthday Brit!

  Aineko (mimicing Brit):
  Or do we go to The Mercury and get
  decent. But at a certain point you need tech skill
  training on CRTs.

  Helga constructed a haiku about Brit:
  britt butler, booze-strong!
  Brit needs poll enhancement help
  i'm cuter than brit

  happy birthday brit i love you even though you are perverted and
  weird. -- alkapwn

  happy birthday brit i love you
  even though you're fucking disgusting -- mannyu

  | Brit,                                                                                   |
  *                                                                                         *
  | Remember when we first met? I interviewed you at CMG. I thought to myself after,        |
  * "either this guy is going to be really fun to be around, or straight up irritating."    *
  | I took a chance on fate, voted for your hire, and waited to see.                        |
  *                                                                                         *
  | It took no time at all to learn that you weren't just fun to be around, but that        |
  * your excitement and enthusiasm for the world was completely inspiring and infectious.   *
  |                                                                                         |
  * To be your friend is to receive kindness and compassion with a fervour equal to what    *
  | you pour into live-debugging Common Lisp applications, and I cherish all of the time    |
  * I get to spend with you.                                                                *
  |                                                                                         |
  * Also, you literally introduced me to Hackers. I don't even know who I would be as a     *
  | human today if not for that. Emacs, too (though Justin helped). And a bunch of music.   |
  * And...I'll just stop there because I'm tearing up.                                      *
  |                                                                                         |
  * love you, friend. happiest birthday.                                                    *
  |  - nate                                                                                 |
